This repo contains the slides and code from my PyCon Australia 2019 presentation "Pragmatic blockchains with Python"

# Abstract 

Beyond cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and other airy-fairy promises of a new world order, blockchain technologies offer many benefits which can serve startups and enterprises right away. Come and learn what these benefits are and how Python can help you reap them!

# Description

Do you have the need to share data between multiple parties who don't trust each other? Do you need a trustworthy system of record? Do you need to apply behavioural economics to incentivise your clients? 

This talk is going to give you a whirlwind explanation of blockchain technologies, before discussing the most common and pragmatic use cases for these technologies and their possible implementations. You'll also get a live demo of two battle tested solutions: the open source [BigchainDB](https://www.bigchaindb.com) and Amazon's [Quantum Ledger Database](https://aws.amazon.com/qldb).

Just like you don't have to understand precisely how the internet works in order to use it, you can benefit from blockchain technologies without having to learn how consensus algorithms or hardware wallets work. All you need is the basic understanding you'll get from this session and some tinkering time.

## Topic experience

I am an old time Pythonista who's fallen in the blockchain bizarro world over the last two years where I've helped launch an ICO on Ethereum, implemented crypto conditions on BigchainDB and tamed immutable ledgers with QLDB.
